This experience can be either simultaneously or over time. Pangender is a multigender that is very expansive and not very specific, meaning that there are so many genders that it’s difficult or impossible to list all of them. There is no maximum limit to the amount of genders. Being pangender is feeling an entire infinite gender spectrum that is possible for an individual to have.

Pansexuality may be considered a sexual orientation in its own right or a branch of bisexuality, to indicate an alternative sexual identity. Because pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women, and pansexuality therefore rejects the gender binary, it is often considered a more inclusive term than bisexual.",
